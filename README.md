# Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on automating breast cancer detection using deep learning techniques applied to mammogram and ultrasound images. We use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as **InceptionV3**, **ResNet-50**, and **VGG-16** to classify images as **Benign** or **Malignant**.

## üß™ Project Objective

- Automate the detection of breast cancer using deep learning.
- Improve diagnostic accuracy over traditional methods.
- Compare CNN models to identify the best-performing architecture.
- Integrate the model into a web application for easy use by clinicians.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow 2.x**
- **Keras**
- **Flask** (for web backend)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (frontend)
- **Pre-trained CNNs**: InceptionV3, ResNet-50, VGG-16

## üß¨ Model Architectures & Results

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| InceptionV3 | 80%      |
| ResNet-50   | 62%      |
| VGG-16      | 57%      |

- Data was sourced from **Kaggle** and **DDSM** (Digital Database for Screening Mammography).
- Preprocessing and augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming were used.



## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-detection.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## üì∑ Web Application Preview

Upload a mammogram or ultrasound image, and the model will predict if the tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** with a confidence score.

## üîç Future Scope

- Add MRI and thermographic image support.
- Real-world clinical validation and explainability (using Grad-CAM, SHAP).
- Lightweight models for low-resource environments.
- Integration into electronic health record systems.
